 //THIS IS THE TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR THE SHOPPING CART PROGRAM
--------------------------------------------------------
README.txt

The README file acts as a table of contents for the MainTest program
which tests the functions of a JFrame created by the Frame.java file.
--------------------------------------------------------
ShoppingCart.java

ShoppingCart.java creates a JFrame object with two text fields and an enter
button. One text field is labeled "Item" and the other is labeled
"Price" as the frame acts as a kind of shopping cart.
--------------------------------------------------------
MainTest.java

MainTest.java tests the varying parts that make up the frame object.
This includes checking that each text field and button does what it
should. The first text field should take in an item name, the second
should take in a price, and the enter button should clear the fields.
--------------------------------------------------------
